Tomorrow is my second silvester in Germany. I can already hear fire works. I got some wine for us. It looked like I wasn't the only one who wanted to do the last minute shopping of the year for tomorrow with some wine and champagne.</p> <p>I finally built my blog, which I promised myself at the beginning of the year. I managed to keep it just one day before the deadline! So I decided to write my first article at the last day of the year. I have tons of stories to tell.</p> <p>2019 changed my life. I was a paralegal at Patent Attorney's office. For me, an iphone was a device of texting and calling, a macbook was a device of storing pictures and watching movies. But this was changed. I joined a bootcamp and learnt how to code. Just a year ago, I didn't even know what HTML or CSS are. Now I am a backend engineer at startup in Berlin and I managed to build my own blog from scratch. Now it may sound 'wow' but the path to get here was a roller coaster.</p> <p>It was certainly a huge challenge for me. I used to come home from bootcamp and told my husband that I cannot do it anymore, I want to quit. My brain was about to explode every single day. I only moved my hands all day but my entire body was exhaused at the end of the day. That's what happens when you use a part of your brain which was not used since you finished your school. But, I couldn't quit. I didn't quit. A few weeks after the graduation, I got a job offer.</p> <p>But. There is a big 'but'. The first few months as a professional engineer was way harder than the bootcamp. From the day 1, I had to solve the issue of the software I've never seen before! I thought I finally got off the roller coaster but I happened to get on the another one! I probably understood quarter of what my colleagues were saying. But again, I didn't quit. I didn't quit reading, researching and finding the solution. After a year of coding, what I learnt is that it's ok not to know everything but there is always a solution to everything no matter how hard it may seems as long as you don't quit.</p> <p>While my career path having a big drama, my personal life also had a big change. I got married. My husband is dutch. I am Japanese. And we are living in Germany. Under this super complicated situation, we managed to put an end to the endless paper work with a huge help from parents and we got married in Japan and Germany. Two down. One more to go (the Netherlands)!</p> <p>I am so ready for 2020. When one door closes, another will open.</p> <p>2020 may bring a lot of joy and happiness to you all!</p> </div> <div class=article-next> <ul class=read_next> <li> &nbsp; </li> <li> <a href="/articles/en/2020/01/01/happy-new-year/">Frohes Neues Jahr! <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i></a> </li> </ul> </div> </article> </section> <span onclick="topFunction()" id=backToTop title="Go to top"><i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i></span> </div> <footer class=wrapper> <div class=footer-section> <div class=footer-column> <span>Article</span> <div class=footer-list> <ul class=hover-line> <li><a href="/" class="list-name active">ALL</a></li> <li><a href="/articles/tags/berlin/" class=list-name>Berlin</a></li> <li><a href="/articles/tags/kyoto/" class=list-name>Kyoto</a></li> <li><a href="/articles/tags/international-marriage/" class=list-name>International marriage</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=footer-column> <span>Year</span> <div class=footer-list> <ul class=footer-list> <li><a href="/articles/2020/">2020</a></li> <li><a href="/articles/2019/">2019</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=footer-column> <span>Links</span> <div class=footer-list> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yama_budo_moto/" target=_blank>Grape diary</a></li> <li><a href="#" target=_blank>Kashiwara</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=footer-column> <span>About</span> <div class=footer-list> <ul> <li><a href="/about/">Yukari</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:mycoupy@outlook.com?subject=From%20yukaricoupy.com&amp;body=%22Thank%20you%20for%20contacting%20me%21%20I%20am%20looking%20forward%20to%20reading%20what%20you%20think%20about%20my%20articles.%20yukaricoupy%22">Contact me</a></li> <li class=language><a href="/jp">日本語</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <p class=copyright>&copy; Copyright 2020 mycoupy</p> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin=anonymous></script> <script defer src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.2/js/all.js"></script> <script src="/javascripts/modernizr-3.5.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/javascripts/application.js"></script> <script>
